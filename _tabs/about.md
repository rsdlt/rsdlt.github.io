Hello, my name is Rodrigo Santiago -`rsdlt`- and here is where I post my personal comments and projects related to the [Rust Programming Language][rpl], technology or other fun stuff I enjoy, like 3D graphics and games. 

I started programming ~20 years ago in `C` and `C++`, but then focused my career on product management and marketing within the telecommunications and financial technology industries; however, the itch for programming never left me...

If you want to contact me, you can reach me at
[my GitHub page](https://github.com/rsdlt) or [rsdlt@pm.me](mailto:rsdlt@pm.me).
